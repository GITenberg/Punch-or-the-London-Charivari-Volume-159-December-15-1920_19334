<h4>CHARIVARIA.</h4>


<p>Apparently the official decision not
to issue Christmas excursion tickets
for journeys of less than one hundred
miles will inflict some inconvenience
on the public. Several correspondents
point out that they will be obliged to
travel further than they had intended.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A newspaper correspondent describes
<span class="sc">Charlie Chaplin</span> as being an amusing
companion in private life. We always
suspect a popular comedian of having
his lighter moments.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"For twenty years," says a contemporary,
"Superintendent Spencer of
Scotland Yard has been watching the
King." We hasten to add that during
all that time <span class="sc">His Majesty</span>
has never done
anything to excite
suspicion.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>This year's Oxford
and Cambridge Rugby
match is said to have
been the most exciting
in the memory of the
oldest undergraduate.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>According to <i>The
Daily Express</i> twenty-five
thousand Government
officials are
on strike in Austria.
People are asking why
we can't have this
sort of thing in England.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Official kissing at
Presidential functions
is now discontinued in
France and visitors must shake hands
in future. These curtailed amenities are
still an improvement on the Mexican
custom of exchanging revolver shots.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Hats," says <i>The Times</i>' fashion
correspondent, "are worn well on the
head." We have always regarded this
as the best place to wear a hat on.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>White spats are to be fashionable
this winter, we read. In muddy weather,
however, the colour-scheme may be
varied. Only the other day we saw
one gentleman wearing a beautiful pair
of Dalmatians.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>So many singers want to run before
they can walk, says Mr. <span class="sc">Ben Davies</span>.
With some singers whom we have
heard, the ability to dodge as well as
run would be an advantage.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Loud cheers were given, says a
Bolshevist wireless message, when
<span class="sc">Lenin</span> left Petrograd for Moscow. We
can well believe it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Bolshevists now forbid men to
walk through the streets with their
hands in their pockets. Hands in other
peoples' pockets every time is their
motto.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A palpitating writer in a Sunday
paper asks if the summit of English
life is being made a true Olympus or a
rooting-ground for the swine of <span class="sc">Epicurus</span>.
Judging by the present exorbitant
price of a nice tender loin of
pork, with crisp crackling, we should
say the former.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A West Norwood man who described
himself as a poet told the
magistrate that he had twice been
knocked down by a motor-cyclist. Our
opinion is that he should have given
up poetry when he was knocked down
the first time.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Winston Churchill</span> cannot be
in two places at once, says <i>The Bristol
Evening News</i>. All the same it is a
dangerous thing to put him on his
mettle like that.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Many people remain oblivious of the
approach of Christmas until the appearance
of mistletoe at Covent Garden.
We don't wait for that; we go by the
appearance in <i>The Daily Mail</i> of a
letter announcing the discovery of primroses in Thanet.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Measures to arrest the subsidence of
the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral have
again become imperative. The cause
assigned is the depressing effect of the
<span class="sc">Dean</span>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Of several hats caught up in a recent
whirlwind it was observed that the
one with the largest circulation was a
"Sandringham."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A judge has decided that it is <i>ultra
vires</i>  for a municipal body to run a
public laundry. Apparently this is to
remain a monopoly of the Royal Courts
of Justice.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"The telephone," we are told, "was
cradled in a dead man's ear." As far
as we can ascertain the other end of
ours is still there.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Seventy is suggested by the London
County Council as the
age limit at which
coroners should retire.
Complete justice cannot
be done as long as
there is anything in
the shape of identity
of interest between
the coroner and the
corpse.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"The natural position
of the eyeballs in
sleep," says a correspondent
of <i>The Daily
Mail</i>, "is turned upwards."
The practice
of leaving them standing
in a tumbler of
water all night should
be particularly avoided
by light sleepers.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We are asked to
deny the rumour that
the <span class="sc">Poet Laureate</span> is entitled to draw
the unemployment donation.</p>

<h3>ABOUT GOLF.</h3>

<p>Golf is obviously the worst game in the world. I doubt
indeed whether it is a game at all.</p>

<p>It is played with a ball, about which, though I could say
much, I will say little. I will not decide whether it should
have a heart of oak or a heart of gold, whether it should
go through a 1&middot;6-inch ring or a plate-glass window, whether
it should sink like the German Navy or float like the British.
Enough, if not too much, has been said about the
standard ball.</p>

<p>Golf is also played with a number of striking implements
more intricate in shape than those used in any other form
of recreation except dentistry. Let so much be agreed.</p>

<p>Now, quite plainly, the essential idea underlying all games
played with a ball, whether a club, stick, mallet, bat or cue
be added or no, is that some interference should take place
with the enemy's action, some thwarting of his purpose or
intent. In Rugby football, to take a case, where no mallet is
used, it is permissible to seize an opponent by the whiskers
and sling him over your right shoulder, afterwards stamping
a few times on his head or his stomach. This thwarts
him badly. The same principle applies, though in a milder
form, to the game of cricket, where you attempt to beat the
adversary's bat with your ball, or, if you have the bat, to
steer the ball between your adversaries, or at least to make
them jolly well wish that you would.</p>

<p>Even with the baser and less heroic ball games, like
croquet and billiards, where more than one ball is used at
a time, action inimical to the interests of the opponent's
ball is permitted and encouraged. Indeed in the good old
days of yore, when croquet was not so strictly scientific, a
shrewd sudden stroke&mdash;the ankle shot, we called it, for,
after all, the fellow was probably not wearing boots&mdash;well, I
daresay you remember it; and I have once succeeded in
paralysing the enemy's cue arm with the red; but this
needs a lot of luck as well as strength, and is not a stroke
to be practised by the beginner, especially on public tables.</p>

<p>We come then again to golf, and see at once that, with
the miserable and cowardly exception of laying the stymie,
there is no stroke in this game that fulfils the proper conditions
which should govern athletic contests involving the
use of spherical objects with or without instruments of
percussion.</p>

<p>And yet we read column after column about fierce encounters
and desperate struggles between old antagonists,
when as a matter of fact there is no struggle, no encounter
at all. Against no other ball game but golf, unless perhaps
it be roulette, can this accusation be laid. Ask a man what
happened last Saturday. "I went out," he says, rather as
if he was the British Expeditionary Force, "in 41; but
I came home"&mdash;he smiles triumphantly; you see the
hospital ship, the cheering crowds&mdash;"in 39." Whether he
beat the other fellow or not he hardly remembers, because
there was in fact no particular reason why the other fellow
should have been there.</p>

<p>Golf matches ought to be arranged, and for my part I
shall arrange them in future, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>He.</i>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Can you play on Saturday at Crump?</p>

<p><i>I.</i>  &nbsp;&nbsp;No, I'm not playing this week.</p>

<p><i>He.</i>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Next week then?</p>

<p><i>I.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, at Blimp.</p>

<p><i>He.</i>  &nbsp;&nbsp;I can't come to Blimp.</p>

<p><i>I.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, let's play all the same. Your score this week
at Crump against mine next week at Blimp, and we'll have
five bob on it.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm not quite sure what his retort is, but you take
my point. It is manifestly absurd to drag the psychological
element into this cold-blooded mathematical pursuit.
After all that England has done and come through in the
last few years, is a man in baggy knickerbockers, with tufts
on the ends of his garters, going to be daunted and foiled
just because a man in slightly baggier knickerbockers and
with slightly larger tufts on his garters has hit a small
white pellet a little further than he has? Hardly, I think.</p>

<p>That is why, when I read long letters in the principal
daily papers about the expense of this so-called game, and
calculations as to whether it can be played for less than
twenty-five shillings a time, I am merely amused. In my
opinion, if the relatives of members of golf-clubs cannot
afford to support them, these institutions should either be
closed or the inmates should be provided with some better
game, like basketball. That is what I feel about golf.</p>

<p>All the same, if Enderby really thinks and believes that,
because in a nasty cross-wind I happened to be slicing
badly and didn't know the course and lost a ball at the
twelfth, and he holed twice out of bunkers and certainly
baulked me by sniffing on the fifteenth tee, and laid a

<h3>OUR HEAVY-WAITS.</h3>

<p>Our Boxing Correspondent sends us
the following gloomy forecast. We have
pointed out to him that Mr. <span class="sc">Cochran</span>
has recently made a definite contract
for a meeting between <span class="sc">Dempsey</span> and
<span class="sc">Carpentier</span>. Our Correspondent replies
that this does not affect his attitude,
and urges us to publish his predictions
of further delay. We do so under
protest.</p>

<p><i>Paris, December 22nd, 1920.</i>&mdash;M. <span class="sc">Deschamps</span>
(<span class="sc">Carpentier's</span> Manager) denies
all knowledge of any agreement with
Mr. <span class="sc">Cochran</span>.</p>

<p><i>New York, December 24th, 1920.</i>&mdash;Mr.
C. B. <span class="sc">Cochran</span> says that <span class="sc">Deschamps</span>
must be dotty. He (C. B.) is returning
by the <i>Mauretania</i> to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>London, April 17th, 1923.</i>&mdash;As Mr.
<span class="sc">Cochran</span> and M. <span class="sc">Deschamps</span> have not
yet come to an agreement the fight for
the World's Heavy-Weight Championship
is indefinitely postponed. <span class="sc">Joe
Beckett</span> meets Bombardier <span class="sc">Wells</span>
to-night at the Circle.</p>

<p><i>London, April 18th, 1923.</i>&mdash;Since the
days of <span class="sc">Jim Corbett</span> no more polished
exponent of the fistic art has graced
the ring than our Bombardier Billy.
Thunders of applause greeted his appearance
in the "mystic square" last
night. He flashed round his ponderous
opponent, mesmerising him with the
purity of his style, the accuracy of his
hitting, the brilliance of his foot-work.
He held the vast audience spell-bound.
<span class="sc">Beckett</span> won on a knock-out in the
second round.</p>

<p><i>London, August 11th, 1924.</i>&mdash;Mr.
<span class="sc">Lovat Fraser</span> in a powerful article
(written <i>entirely</i> in italics) in <i>The Daily
Mail</i>  points out the fearful tension the
peace of Europe is undergoing through
the continued differences between
Messrs. <span class="sc">Cochran</span> and <span class="sc">Deschamps</span>, and
demands to know what the <span class="sc">Premier</span>
is doing about it.</p>

<p><i>London, August 24th, 1924.</i>&mdash;Mr.
<span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>, acting under Mr. <span class="sc">Lovat
Fraser's</span> orders, has gone to Lympne
(kindly lent by Sir <span class="sc">Philip Sassoon</span>),
where he will be joined by Mr. <span class="sc">Cochran</span>,
M. <span class="sc">Deschamps</span> and M. <span class="sc">Millerand</span>.</p>

<p><i>London, September 30th, 1924.</i>&mdash;The
whole civilised world will rejoice to
hear that the differences between Mr.
C. B. <span class="sc">Cochran</span> and M. <span class="sc">Deschamps</span>
have at last been amicably settled. The
great fight for the world's heavy-weight
championship is fixed to take place at
Olympia on November 17th. <span class="sc">Dempsey</span>
is to receive £100,000, <span class="sc">Carpentier</span>
£75,000.</p>

<p><i>London, October 4th, 1924.</i>&mdash;It appears
that Olympia was already booked for
November for <i>The Daily Mail's</i> Ideal
Pyjama Exhibition, and Mr. C. B. <span class="sc">Cochran</span>
has to-day issued a <i>communiqué</i>  to
the Press Association to the effect that
the contest will be held definitely in Sark
(Channel Islands) on December 23rd.
He has hired the entire Cunard and
White Star Fleets for the day, and those
who cannot find standing room on the
island will be provided with seats and
telescopes in the ships' riggings. All
will be welcome at fifty guineas a head.</p>

<p><i>New York, October 6th, 1924.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Dempsey</span>
denies that he is meeting <span class="sc">Carpentier</span>
on December 23rd. He laughs at
the idea of fighting for £100,000.</p>

<p>"Heaven knows I am not mercenary,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page465" id="page465"></a>[pg 465]</span>
he says, "but there's such a thing as
a living wage."</p>

<p><i>London, October 7th, 1924.</i>&mdash;Mr.
C. B. <span class="sc">Cochran</span>, in an interview granted
to our reporter yesterday, says that he
has done with fight-promoting for ever
and will in future concentrate on performing
seals.</p>

<p><i>London, October 10th, 1924.</i>&mdash;A sensation
was caused at the Circle last night
when an old man jumped unannounced
into the ring and offered to fight anyone
living to a finish for five pounds and a
pint of beer for the sheer fun of the
thing. The disturber, who was obviously
out of his senses, was quickly removed.
His identity has not so far been established,
but he is thought to be a fighter of
the old school escaped from confinement.</p>

<p>No authoritative announcement has
been made as to who will assume
Mr. <span class="sc">Cochran's</span> extensive boxing engagements,
but rumour is busy with
the name of Mr. <span class="sc">Mallaby-Deeley</span>.</p>

<p><i>New York, January 31st, 1925.</i>&mdash;Mr.
W. <span class="sc">Brady</span>, the veteran fight-promoter,
has signed up J. <span class="sc">Dempsey</span> and
<span class="sc">Georges Carpentier</span> to meet at Havana,
Cuba, on Easter Monday, 1925.
<span class="sc">Dempsey</span> will draw £200,000, <span class="sc">Carpentier</span>
£150,000.</p>

<p><i>New York, February 8th, 1925.</i>&mdash;Following
Mr. W. <span class="sc">Brady's</span> announcement,
Mr. <span class="sc">Tex Rickards</span> (promoter of the
<span class="sc">Jeffries-Johnson</span> contest) has now
come forward, stating that <span class="sc">Dempsey</span>
and <span class="sc">Carpentier</span> have signed a contract
with him to fight at Nome, Alaska, on
Shrove Tuesday, for a quarter-of-a-million
each.</p>

<p><i>New York, February 19th, 1925.</i>&mdash;Mr.
C. B. <span class="sc">Cochran</span>, who arrived on the
<i>Aquitania</i> this morning, says that the
two champions have contracted to
meet under his management at Tristan
d'Acunha on Good Friday for half-a-million
each and a percentage on the
popcorn and peanut sales.</p>

<p><i>New York, March 3rd, 1925.</i>&mdash;With
the view of lifting the national depression
consequent on the hitch in the
world's championship arrangements,
Mr. <span class="sc">Henry Ford</span>, whose successes as
a mediator are celebrated, is labouring
to bring about a conciliatory meeting
between the rival promoters.</p>

<p><i>New York, July 12th, 1925.</i>&mdash;Mr.
<span class="sc">Henry Ford's</span> efforts, fortified by the
prayers of the Rev. <span class="sc">William Sunday</span>,
have at length borne fruit. Messrs.
<span class="sc">Brady</span>, <span class="sc">Cochran</span> and <span class="sc">Rickards</span> have
consented to talk matters over. The
White House has been placed entirely
at the disposal of the promoters, their
families, secretaries, legal advisers, etc.</p>

<p><i>Washington, D.C., July 20th, 1925.</i>&mdash;Mr.
<span class="sc">Henry Ford's</span> "Peace Party" has
not proved an unqualified success.
Battle royal broke out among the delegates
at noon yesterday. Messrs. <span class="sc">Brady</span>,
<span class="sc">Cochran</span> and <span class="sc">Rickards</span> have been taken
to hospital, but are not expected to recover.
The White House is in ruins.</p>


<h4><span class="sc">The Great Fight.</span></h4>

<p><i>Geneva, July 4th, 1960.</i>&mdash;The fight for
the Heavyweight Championship of the
World, held under the auspices of the
League of Nations, took place yesterday
before a gigantic crowd. <span class="sc">Dempsey</span>, who
now wears a flowing white beard, was
wheeled into the ring in a bath-chair.
<span class="sc">Carpentier</span>, now wholly bald, appeared
on crutches and was seconded by two
trained nurses and his youngest grandson.
Both champions were assisted to
their feet by their supporters, shook
hands and immediately clinched. In this
clinch they remained throughout the
entire round, fast asleep. At the opening
of the second round they attempted
to clinch again, but missed each other,
overbalanced and went to the mat.
Neither could be persuaded to get up,
and consequently both were counted
out.</p>

<p>It is therefore impossible to say who
won or who lost, and the Heavyweight
Championship of the World remains
as open a question as ever.</p>

<h3>EVE VICTORIOUS.</h3>

<p>"Aren't girls funny, Uncle Alan?"
said Christopher.</p>

<p>"Christopher," I answered, "girls
are the very dickens. You can't trust
'em. Never have anything to do with
girls, my boy."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to," said Christopher.</p>

<p>This is what we said to each other
afterwards. If either of us had thought
of it before&mdash;&mdash; &nbsp;But that's the usual
way, of course.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Christopher and I were sitting by the
fire. We were very peaceful and happy
together, pretending to look at a book
but really doing nothing at all.</p>

<p>Then Dorothy came into the room.
Dorothy is Christopher's cousin and six
years old. Not that her age matters&mdash;six,
sixteen or sixty, they are all the
same.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" inquired
Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Nothing," murmured Christopher
contentedly.</p>

<p>"I wanted you to come and play with
me."</p>

<p>Christopher shuffled uneasily and I
came to the rescue.</p>

<p>"Not now, Dorothy," I said; "we
are too comfortable. Come and have a
look at this book with us."</p>

<p>Dorothy looked at me as though she
had just realised my presence.</p>

<p>"I want Christopher to come and
play with me," she repeated.</p>

<p>Christopher has a fine old-fashioned
idea of a host's duty to his guests. He
stifled a yawn and slid from my knee.</p>

<p>"All right, Dorothy," he said. "What
shall we play?"</p>

<p>Dorothy skipped like a young lamb.
"Hide and Seek," she sang. "I'll go
and hide. Don't look till I call."</p>

<p>She danced gaily and triumphantly
out of the room.</p>

<p>Now I don't mind being snubbed and
I certainly shouldn't trouble about a
spot of a child who ought to have been
kept in the nursery. Of course it's
ridiculous even to begin explaining, isn't
it? The thing's obvious. No, I felt
that Dorothy should be taught a lesson;
that is all. I thought it would be good
for her.</p>

<p>"That settles Dorothy," I said deliberately.
"Now we can go on reading."</p>

<p>"But she wants me to go and look
for her," explained Christopher.</p>

<p>"Then let her want," I said shortly.
"We can't always be&mdash;&mdash; &nbsp;Christopher,
we'll have a game with Dorothy. We'll
stop where we are and let her look for
herself."</p>

<p>Christopher chuckled. "She'll be
awfully angry," he said uncertainly.</p>

<p>"Good!" said I.</p>

<p>"Cooee!" came a voice from the
far-away. We laughed guiltily to ourselves
and settled down in the chair. The
scheme proceeded according to plan.</p>

<p>After sundry shrieks and screeches and
whistles Dorothy grew impatient and
adopted bolder tactics.</p>

<p>"You can't find me," she called hopefully.</p>

<p>I felt that it was time for a little encouragement.</p>

<p>"I wonder where she can be?" I said
loudly.</p>

<p>There was a long silence. At last
Dorothy grew desperate. "Look under
the armchair in the hall," she called.</p>

<p>Christopher and I smiled to ourselves.
Then suddenly we heard her creeping
towards the door. I blame Christopher
for what followed.</p>

<p>"She's coming," he whispered excitedly.
"Let's hide."</p>

<p>There was no time to think. We
slipped rapidly under the table. A ridiculous
thing to do, of course; so undignified.
I kick myself when I think of
it, but at the time&mdash;&mdash; &nbsp;Well, it was
Christopher's fault for getting excited.
So there we were squashed under the
table when the door opened and Dorothy
appeared.</p>

<p>"I don't believe&mdash;&mdash;" &nbsp;she began, and
then stopped. "Why, they're not here,"
she gasped. And then Christopher spoilt
everything by spluttering. I strangled
him at once and we hoped that
Dorothy hadn't heard. We saw her
legs standing very still by the door.
Then they moved quickly round the
table to the fireplace. Christopher and
I held our breaths and waited. We saw
that Dorothy was pulling our chair
round to face the fire. Then she sat
herself in it and all we could see was
the back of the chair.</p>

<p>There was a great silence. Christopher
and I looked at each other and
decided that something must be done.</p>

<p>I cleared my throat quietly. "Cooee!"
I fluted.</p>

<p>Dorothy began to sing a hymn in a
loud voice.</p>

<p>And then Cecilia came into the room.</p>

<p>Now Cecilia is Christopher's mother
and my sister. You will understand that
neither Christopher nor I would care
to appear ridiculous in front of her. So
we kept quiet.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Dorothy," said Cecilia; "all
by yourself? Where's Christopher?"</p>

<p>"I'm reading Christopher's book,"
said Dorothy, ignoring the question.
"May I?"</p>

<p>"Of course, dear," said Cecilia, sitting
down. There was a lot more silence.
It grew very hot and uncomfortable
under the table.</p>

<p>"What shall we do, Uncle?" whispered
Christopher.</p>

<p>"Come on," I said desperately. We
crawled out and stood up.</p>

<p>"What on earth&mdash;&mdash;" &nbsp;began Cecilia.</p>

<p>I managed a watery smile. "<i>Here</i>
we are," I said to Dorothy.</p>

<p>Dorothy looked at us in surprise.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i>  untidy," she said. "Whatever
have you been doing?"</p>

<p>Christopher swallowed indignantly.
"We were playing 'Hide and Seek' with
you," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I stopped playing a long time
ago," said Dorothy. "I'm reading
now." She turned to our book again.
Cecilia began to laugh.</p>

<p>"Come and have a wash, Christopher,"
I said in a strangled voice, and
we moved off sheepishly.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Aren't girls funny, Uncle Alan?"
said Christopher.</p>

<p>"Christopher," I answered, "girls are
the very&mdash;&mdash;" &nbsp;Well, I told you at the
beginning what we said to each other.</p>

<h3>LITTLE BITS OF LONDON.</h3>

<h4><span class="sc1">Bond Street</span>.</h4>

<p>I find it very difficult to walk slowly
down Bond Street as one ought to do;
I always feel so guilty. Most of the
people there look scornfully at me as
if I belonged to Whitechapel, and the
rest look suspiciously at me as if I
belonged to Bond Street. My clothes
are neither good enough nor bad
enough. So I hurry through with the
tense expression of a man who is merely
using Bond Street as a thoroughfare,
because it is the way to his dentist&mdash;as
indeed in my case it is. But recently
I <i>did</i> saunter in the proper way, and I
took a most thrilling inventory of the
principal classes of shops, the results of
which have now been tabulated by my
statistical department.</p>

<p>For instance, do you know
how many shops in the street
sell things for ladies to wear
(not including boots, jewellery
or shoes)? No? Well, there
are thirty-three. Not many,
is it? But then there are
twenty-one jewellers (including
pearl shops) and eight boot
and/or shoe shops; so that, with
two sort of linen places, which
may fairly be reckoned as
female, the ladies' total is sixty-four.
I only counted a hundred-and-fifty
shops altogether.
Of that total, nine are places
where men can buy things to
wear, and ten are places where
they can buy things to smoke;
I have charitably debited all
the cigarette-shops to the men,
even the ones where the cigarettes
are tipped with rose-leaves
and violet-petals. But
even if I do that and give the
men the two places where you can buy
guns and throw in the one garden-seat
shop, we are left with the
result:&mdash;</p>

<p>From these figures a firm of Manchester
actuaries has drawn the startling
conclusion that Bond Street is
more used by women than by men. It
may be so. But a more interesting
question is, how do all these duplicates
manage to carry on, considering the
very reasonable prices they charge?
At one point there are three jewellers
in a row, with another one opposite.
Not far off there are three cigarette-shops
together, madly defying each
other with gold-tips and silver-tips,
cork-tips and velvet-tips, rose-tips and
lily-tips. There is only one book-shop,
of course, but there are about nine picture-places.
How do they all exist? It is mysterious.</p>

<p>Especially when you consider how
much trouble they take to avoid attracting
attention. There are still one or
two window-dressers who lower the
whole tone of the street by adhering
to the gaudy-overcrowded style; but
the majority, in a violent reaction from
that, seem to have rushed to the wildest
extremes of the simple-unobtrusive.
They are delightful, I think, those reverent
little windows with the chaste
curtains and floors of polished walnut,
in the middle of which reposes delicately
a single toque, a single chocolate
or a single pearl. Some of the picture-places
are among the most modest.
There is one window which suggests
nothing but the obscure branch of a
highly-decayed bank in the dimmest
cathedral town. On the dingy screen
which entirely fills the window is written
simply in letters which time has almost
erased, "&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; <span class="sc">Pictures</span>." Nothing
could be less enticing. Yet inside,
I daresay, fortunes are made daily.
I noticed no trace of this method at
the Advertisers' Exhibition; they might
give it a trial.</p>

<p>Now no doubt you fondly think that
Bond Street is wholly devoted to
luxuries; perhaps you have abandoned
your dream of actually buying something
in Bond Street? You are wrong.
To begin with, there are about ten
places where you can buy food, and,
though there is no pub. now, there is a
café (with a licence). There are two
grocers and a poulterer. There is even
a fish-shop&mdash;you didn't know that, did
you? I am bound to say it seemed to
have only the very largest fish, but they
were obviously fish.</p>

<p>Anyone can go shopping in Bond
Street. I knew a clergyman once who
went in and asked for a back-stud. He
was afterwards unfrocked for riotous
living, but the stud was produced. You
can buy a cauliflower in Bond Street&mdash;if
you know the ropes. There is a shop
which merely looks like a very beautiful
florist's. There are potatoes in the
window, it is true, but they are "hot-house"
ones; inside there is no trace
of a common vegetable. But if you
ask facetiously for a cauliflower (as I
did) the young lady will disappear below
ground and actually return with a real
cauliflower (<i>de luxe</i>,  of course).
I remember few more embarrassing
episodes.</p>

<p>And if you like to inquire at
the magnificent provision-merchant's
he too will conjure up
from the magic cellars boot-cream
and metal-polish and all
those vulgar groceries which
make life possible. That is the
secret of Bond Street. Beneath
that glittering display of luxurious
trivialities there are
vast reserves of solid prosaic
necessaries, only waiting to be
asked for. A man could live
exclusively on Bond Street. I
don't know where you would
buy your butchers' meat, but I
have a proud fancy that, if you
went in and said something to
one of those sleek and sorrowful
jewellers, he too would vanish
underground and blandly return
to you with a jewelled
steak or a plush chop.</p>

<p>Many years ago, they tell me, there
<i>was</i>  a butcher in Bond Street. Perhaps
you dealt there. For my part I
was not eating much meat in those
days. But I can imagine his window&mdash;a
perfect little grotto of jasper and
onyx, with stalactites of pure gold, and
in the middle, resting on a genuine
block of Arctic ice, an exquisite beef-sausage.
I wish he would come back.</p>

<p>It is difficult to realise that there is
anything but shop-windows in Bond
Street, but I like to think that, up there
in those upper storeys which one never
sees, there does dwell a self-contained
little community to whom Bond Street
is merely the village street, down which
the housewives pass gossiping each
morning to the greengrocer's or the
fishmonger's and never purchase any
pearls at all.</p>

<p>When the butcher comes back I think
I shall join them.</p>

<h3>THE SAD CASE OF EL GRECO.</h3>

<p>It was at the National Gallery, situated
on the north side of Trafalgar
Square, that I first made the acquaintance
of one <span class="sc">Domenico Theotocopuli</span>,
a native of Crete, who&mdash;probably because
his own people wanted him to
be a stockbroker or something&mdash;set up
as a painter in Spain, and was dubbed
by the Dons "El Greco," as you might
say "Scottie."</p>

<p>For years I have been rather tickled
by his manner of depicting Popes and
Saints as if they were reflected in elongating
mirrors labelled, "Before Dining
at the Toreador Restaurant." But until
quite lately I hardly ever met anyone
who had even noticed him, so I felt
quite bucked on the old chap's account
when I heard that he was considered
one of the most distinguished of the
Spanish painters, past and present, who
are on view just now at Burlington
House.</p>

<p>And what surprises me is not that
old <span class="sc">Theotocopuli</span> should attract so
much attention in Piccadilly, but that
such lots of people seem never to have
known that he has been exhibiting himself
all this time in Trafalgar Square.</p>

<p>I'm sure Mrs. Bletherwood didn't,
for one, when she tackled me at the
Chattertons' the other afternoon.</p>

<p>"Of course you've been to Burlington
House?" she began, and she was
in such a hurry to get first innings that
she didn't give me time to say that I
hadn't yet, but that I meant to go on
my first free day that wasn't foggy.</p>

<p>"Don't you <i>love</i> those quaint 'El
Grecos'?" she went on. "He's quite
a discovery, don't you think? My
daughter Muriel, who hopes to get into
the Slade School soon now, says she
doesn't see how anybody <i>can</i> see people
differently from the way 'El Greco' saw
people. And yet I don't know that I
<i>quite</i> like the idea of Muriel seeing <i>me</i>
like that, although she's <i>so</i> clever...."</p>

<p>I could not help thinking that in
Mrs. Bletherwood's case the "El Greco"
treatment would be an admirable corrective
to a certain lateral expansion.</p>

<p>"Besides," she continued in a confidential
tone, "I've heard or read somewhere
that there's just a doubt whether
he distorted people on purpose or because
there was something wrong with
his eyes. If I thought it was astigmatism
I would insist on taking Muriel to
an oculist. I wonder what you think."</p>

<p>I raised my teacup suggestively.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bletherwood gasped. "You
don't mean that he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like a fish," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, how too disgraceful!" she exclaimed.
"Fancy their having his pictures
there at all. Such religious subjects
too. I shall warn Muriel at once.
I'm so thankful you told me...."</p>

<p>Have I done a wrong to Señor
<span class="sc">Domenico Theotocopuli</span> ("El Greco")?
Perhaps; but I hope it has prevented
Miss Muriel Bletherwood from doing
him a greater.</p>

<h3>CURES FOR INSOMNIA.</h3>

<p>The following correspondence, clearly
intended for the Editor of <i>The Daily
Ailment</i>,  has found its way into our
letter-box. Another example of post-office
inefficiency.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;As a regular reader of your
valuable journal I am always deeply
interested in the views of your readers
as expressed in its columns. The recent
letters on the cure of insomnia have
interested me particularly. Although
I have read your paper for many years,
always eaten standard bread, study
most diligently each morning my lesson
on Government wobble and waste, grow
sweet peas, keep fowls, take my holidays
early (in Thanet) and read the
feuilleton, in short perform all the duties
of an enthusiastic loyal Englishman, I
cannot sleep. Yesterday I decided to
try the remedies suggested by your
readers.</p>

<p>After inviting sleep with "a dish of
boiled onions" I found that I must go
to bed "without having eaten anything
for five hours or so." This meant sitting
up very late, but I found the time
useful for taking "deep long breaths."
Meanwhile I ran through the names
of my friends alphabetically and emptied
the feathers from my pillow, replacing
them with hops. Sometimes
a hop got mixed up in a "deep long
breath," which was rather pleasant.</p>

<p>Every few minutes I left my friends'
names to say to myself, "I am terribly
sleepy," or "I am falling asleep;" this
was wrong, as the boiled onions had
not had nearly five hours. "Relaxing
all my muscles" was rather awkward,
as one hand was filling the pillow with
hops and the other was "holding a wet
sponge," which <i>would</i> drip water on
the sheets. Another difficulty was
"wafting myself in an imaginary aeroplane"
to bring about "a state of oblivion
and coma," which I might perhaps
have done more easily by putting
the hops to another use.</p>

<p>I had to cut out the "recital of the
Litany," partly because my friends'
names had only got as far as George
(Lloyd), and also because, being a Nonconformist,
I don't know it. (I must
learn it now the feuilleton is finishing.)</p>

<p>But the most annoying part of the
business was to find that, after all this
elaborate preparation for sleep, I was
to "take a brisk walk for half-an-hour"
(whatever the weather conditions).
Even this did not work, for by that
time the milkmen and newsboys were
heralding the dawn and kept my brain
too alert.</p>

<p>As a final effort, do you think you
could produce a nightcap model of the
Sandringham, or is it quite impossible
for one who reads your paper to be
anything but wideawake?</p>

<p><i>Monday, December 6th.</i>&mdash;"Logic has
never governed Ireland and never will,"
said Lord <span class="sc">Midleton</span> to-day. It was
certainly conspicuous by its absence
from a good many of the speeches made
in Committee on the Government of
Ireland Bill. Representatives of Southern
Ireland have been clamouring for
greater financial control, but they quite
changed their tone when Clause 24, enabling
the Irish Parliaments to impose
a surtax upon residents in Ireland, came
up for discussion. While professing the
greatest confidence in the desire of their
fellow-countrymen to treat them fairly,
Lords <span class="sc">Drogheda</span>, <span class="sc">Sligo</span> and <span class="sc">Wicklow</span>
agreed in thinking that this was too
dangerous a power to entrust to them;
it would breed absenteeism and drive
capital out of the country.</p>

<p>Lord <span class="sc">Finlay</span>, to whom as a Scotsman
logic still makes appeal, was for the
deletion of the whole clause. But the
Irish Peers again objected; for they
desired to preserve for the Irish Parliaments
power to remit Imperial taxes,
on the off-chance that some day it
might be exercised. And they carried
their point.</p>

<p>According to Lieut.-Colonel <span class="sc">Croft</span>
the pencils used by the British Post-Office
are procured from the United
States. As one who has suffered I can
only hope that Anglo-American friendship,
already somewhat strained by the
bacon episode, will survive this revelation.</p>

<p>On the strength of a rumour that the
seed of Irish peace had been planted in
Downing Street, Mr. <span class="sc">Hogge</span> promptly
essayed to root it up in order to observe
its progress towards fruition. The <span class="sc">Prime
Minister</span>, however, gave no encouragement
to his well-intentioned efforts.
Nor did he satisfy Lieut.-Commander
<span class="sc">Kenworthy's</span> curiosity as to whether
Father <span class="sc">O'Flanagan</span> was "a Sinn Feiner
on the bridge," beyond saying "that is
what we want to find out."</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, December 7th.</i>&mdash;After a
week's interval for reflection and study
Lord <span class="sc">Lincolnshire</span> moved the rejection
of the Agriculture Bill. Adapting an
old joke of Lord <span class="sc">Spencer's</span>, made in
"another place" a generation ago, he
observed that this was no more an
agricultural Bill than he himself was
an agricultural labourer. He knows
however how to call a spade a spade,
if not something more picturesque, and
he treated the measure and its authors
to all the resources of a varied vocabulary.
Possibly his brother peers, while
enjoying his invective, thought that
it had been a little bit overdone, for
of the subsequent speakers only Lord
<span class="sc">Hindlip</span> announced his intention of
voting against the Bill, the others being
of opinion that parts of it were, not excellent
perhaps, but at least tolerable.</p>

<p>In the Commons Viscount <span class="sc">Curzon</span>
pressed upon the Government the desirability
of licensing side-car combinations
as taxi-cabs. The idea might, one
feels, appeal to a Coalition Government
but Sir <span class="sc">John Baird</span> for the Home
Office hinted at the existence of "serious
objections."</p>

<p>Collectively the House has an infantile
mind. It went into kinks of laughter
over a question put by Dr. <span class="sc">Murray</span>
regarding the "daily mail service"
between one of his beloved islands and
the Scottish mainland. The author of
the joke&mdash;and small blame to him&mdash;quite
failed to appreciate how funny he
had been until his neighbours muttered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page474" id="page474"></a>[pg 474]</span>
in stage-whispers, "<i>Daily Mail!</i>"
"<i>Daily Mail!</i>" Then a wan smile broke
over his own features.</p>

<p>It has been stated in certain newspapers
that Mr. <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> has refused
the Viceroyalty of India in consequence
of the weak state of his health,
and that for the same cause he is likely
to vacate shortly the Chancellorship of
the Exchequer. All I can say is that
on the Treasury Bench he betrays no
outward sign of this regrettable debility
when dealing with critics of the Treasury.
It is not easy to puncture the <i>æs
triplex</i> of Mr. <span class="sc">Bottomley</span>, but two
words from Mr. <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> did it
this afternoon.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">Robert Horne</span> got a second reading
for the Dyes Bill, a
measure which he commended
as being necessary
to protect what is
a key-industry both in
peace and war. Dye-stuffs
and poison-gas
are, it seems, inextricably
intermingled, and
unless the Bill is passed
we shall be able neither
to dye ourselves nor to
poison our enemies.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, December
8th.</i>&mdash;The Agriculture
Bill found one thoroughgoing
supporter in the
Duke of <span class="sc">Marlborough</span>,
an "owner-occupier"
so enamoured of Government
control that
he desires to see the
whole of the ditches
and hedges of England
administered out of
public funds; and a host
of critics, friendly and
otherwise. Lord <span class="sc">Chaplin</span>,
though he thought
the Bill one of the worst ever introduced,
declined to vote against the
Second Reading; Lord <span class="sc">Harris</span> believed
that it would make very little difference
one way or the other; Lord <span class="sc">Ribblesdale</span>,
as an old-fashioned Free Trader,
would have nothing to do with it; Lord
<span class="sc">Lovat</span> was of opinion that as an insurance
for our food supply it would not
compare with a Channel Tunnel; and
Lord <span class="sc">Buckmaster</span> feared that it would
rather strengthen than allay the demand
for land nationalisation. The Government
approached the division in some
trepidation and were the more rejoiced
when, in an unusually big House, the
Second Reading was carried by 123 votes
to 85.</p>

<p>But for the self-sacrifice of Mr.
<span class="sc">Speaker</span> the Commons would have
made themselves ridiculous this evening.
Major <span class="sc">Archer-Shee</span> wanted to
have up a certain newspaper for breach
of privilege in endeavouring to dictate
to Members how they should vote. He
obtained leave to move the adjournment
and would doubtless have provided the
peccant journal with a valuable free
advertisement had not Mr. <span class="sc">Lowther</span>,
reckless of his reputation for infallibility,
suddenly remembered that motions
for the adjournment were intended
for criticising the Government and not
for rebuking irresponsible outsiders. At
his request the gallant Major withdrew
his motion, and <i>The Daily</i> &mdash;&mdash; lost
its advertisement.</p>

<p>Invigorated by this episode the House&mdash;or
what was left of it&mdash;resumed the
Report stage of the Ministry of Health
Bill. The debate was remarkable for
the brevity of some of the speeches.
Sir <span class="sc">Rowland Blades</span> set a good example
to new Members by making a
"maiden" effort in a minute and a
half. But his record was easily beaten
by Mr. <span class="sc">Sexton</span>, who found ten seconds
sufficient for expressing his opinion that
the fact that the House was trying to
legislate in the small hours was sufficient
proof of the necessity of extending
the laws of lunacy. "<i>Si argumentum
requiris circumspice</i>," he might have
said as he gazed upon the recumbent
and yawning figures around him.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, December 9th.</i>&mdash;Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar
Law</span> enumerated a portentous list of
measures which the House of Commons
must pass if it wants to enjoy its
Christmas holidays in peace. Lord
<span class="sc">Hugh Cecil</span> wanted to know what
was the use of passing "all these foolish
little Bills." Mr. <span class="sc">Pemberton Billing</span>
had another solution for the difficulty
and asked, "Why not pass them all
<i>ad hoc</i>?" meaning, it is supposed, "<i>en
bloc</i>."</p>

<p>Well might the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> remark
at Question-time that he welcomed
the attacks of a certain section of the
Press on the "Wastrels" because then
he knew the Government was all right.
Mr. <span class="sc">George Lambert</span> made a lively
speech in support of his proposal to
"ration" the Government to a sum of
£808,000,000&mdash;the amount Mr. <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>
had said would suffice for a
normal year. But his criticisms were
too discursive to be really dangerous,
and his condemnation of "sloppy Socialism"
put up the backs
of the Labour Party.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Chancellor Of
the Exchequer</span> reminded
the House that
when he talked of a
"normal Budget" he
had been careful to add,
"but not this year, next
year or the year after,"
which sounds suspiciously
like the nursery
formula, "This year,
next year, sometime,
<span class="sc">never</span>."</p>

<p>Still the great majority
of the Members were
only too anxious to be
convinced, and passed
by a huge majority the
"blanketing" amendment
of Sir <span class="sc">Godfrey
Collins</span> in favour of
economy in the abstract.
I don't know how this is
to be squared with the
<span class="sc">Prime Minister's</span>
theory that it is the business
of the Government
"to see that the population is contented."
That sounds a little like <i>panem
et circenses</i>&mdash;a policy which did not
work out cheaply.</p>

<p><i>Friday, December 10th.</i>&mdash;With the
air of one who has something fresh and
strange to impart the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>
informed the House of Commons to-day
that in regard to Ireland "the Government
are determined on a double policy."
The novelty presumably consists in
putting those old stagers, conciliation
and coercion, hitherto only tried tandem-fashion,
into double harness. Martial
law is to be introduced in certain of
the most disturbed districts, and at the
same time such Sinn Fein M.P.'s as are
not "on the run" are to be called into
conference. On the face of it the prospect
looks unpromising, but happily
Ireland is essentially the place where
nothing happens save the unexpected.</p>

<h3>MAKING THE LAW POPULAR.</h3>

<p>A writer in an evening contemporary
complains that one has some difficulty
in finding the notices to jurors in the
newspapers.</p>

<p>We have often thought that more
prominence might be given to the
Law Notices generally. Printed in the
smallest type and abbreviated almost
beyond understanding, they are by no
means the brightest item of news.</p>

<p>Would it not be an advantage to hand
the department over to a smart paragraphist?
Readers might then be
entertained by something like the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Visitors to the Law Courts to-day
should on no account fail to look in at
King's Bench XIII., which is one of
the cosiest of our beautiful Courts of
Justice. Here will be continued the
scintillating contest between Sir Anthony
Prius, K.C., and that rising young
barrister, Mr. Terry Blee-Smart, K.C.
It is more than probable that the cross-examination
of the humorous butcher
will continue through most of the day.</p>

<p>The first case on the list in the
Lord Chief's Court to-day is no other
than <i>The King</i> v. <i>The Dean and Chapter
of Mumborough Cathedral</i>. While it is
not expected that his Majesty's engagements
will permit him to be present,
an action of this character is fraught
with more than common interest, since
it must be seldom that the Royal House
finds itself in such conflict with the
Church as to resort to the arbitrament
of the law.</p>

<p>We see no reason why some legal
engagements should not be boldly displayed,
the more readily to catch the
reader's eye. Why not the following:&mdash;</p>

<h3>THE OTHER HALF.</h3>

<p>I was sitting by Anderson's fire the
other day when his telephone bell rang.
He made the usual insincere exclamation
of disgust&mdash;as insincere as the
horror we simulate when a bundle of
letters is brought into the room, to
have letters and to be called up on the
telephone being really adventures and
therefore welcome; and he then crossed
the room to answer the call.</p>

<p>"Shall I go?" I asked, thinking that
he might prefer to be alone.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he said, and I remained.
I was not trying to overhear, but it
couldn't be helped.</p>

<p>This is the conversation (his half) that
I heard:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Speaking. Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad! I was getting
horribly nervous. How is he?"</p>

<p>"Good Heavens! I was afraid he
might be. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"Of course I must trust you. But
we must never let my wife know."</p>

<p>"I'll think about it and let you
know."</p>

<p>"Quite likely. I'll go into that and
let you know. She can't be absolutely
alone anyway. There must be another
some time."</p>

<p>"And what do you propose to do
now?"</p>

<p>"You're sure it will be painless?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have him suffer for anything."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much. I shall tell
my wife he died in his sleep. Good-bye."</p>

<p>What, I wonder, would you have
made of that? Some telephone conversations
are easy to construct, but
this to me was a puzzle. What had
Anderson been up to? It must be an
awful moment, I have often thought
as I read divorce and other cases, when
a friend is suddenly turned into a witness;
and I had the feeling that that
might be my lot now. Those clever
cross-examining devils, they can get
anything out of you. If Anderson had
known who was ringing him up he
would probably (so I reasoned) have
got me out of the room; but, having
once started, he decided to brazen it out
as the less suspicious way.</p>

<p>As so often happens, however, I was
wrong. This is the whole innocent
conversation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is that 1260?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Anderson there?"</p>

<p>"Speaking. Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Harding, the veterinary surgeon."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad! I was getting
horribly nervous. How is he?"</p>

<p>"He's worse."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens! I was afraid he
might be. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"I think we had better put an end
to him."</p>

<p>"Of course I must trust you. But
we must never let my wife know."</p>

<p>"Shall I be looking about for another?"</p>

<p>"I'll think about it and let you know."</p>

<p>"Perhaps a totally different breed
would be better; not another Peke.
There'd be fewer unhappy associations
then, don't you see?"</p>

<p>"Quite likely. I'll go into that and
let you know. She can't be absolutely
alone, anyway. There must be another
some time."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And what do you propose to do
now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll give him poison."</p>

<p>"You're sure it will be painless?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have him suffer for anything."</p>

<p>"That will be all right."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much. I shall tell
my wife he died in his sleep. Good-bye."</p>

<h3>THE MOUNTAIN AND THE PROPHETS.</h3>

<p>My dear Charles,&mdash;At Geneva
there is, and was long before the arrival
of the League of Nations, a mountain.
There are many mountains in
Switzerland, but Geneva's private
mountain happens to be in France. It
is called "The Salève," a nasty name,
but not of my choosing. If, being in
Geneva, you want to go up The Salève
(as I personally do not) you have first
to get your passport off the police. The
police are always a little difficult about
passports, but, if you mention the name
of The Salève, you will find them easier.
You have next to obtain the French
<i>visa</i> in order to get out of Geneva;
then the Swiss <i>visa</i> in order to get
back again. Thus provided you have
to compete with a complicated and
long-drawn process of trams and frontier
controls; even so you find yourself
at the bottom and not at the top of The
Salève.</p>

<p>Being a busy (or shall we say idle?)
man yourself, you will thus understand
the reasons of my policy; if the mountain
will not come to <span class="sc">Mahomed</span> then
<span class="sc">Mahomed</span> and the mountain are best
kept apart.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Geneva have long
been contriving, intriguing, I will even
say complotting, to get me up The Salève.
My doctor, having made me thoroughly
interested in myself, got on to the subject
of exercise; when my banker passed
from the subject of interest on overdrafts
to the advisability of my seeing
the great Geneva view, it was undoubtedly
blackmail; and as for my
dentist&mdash;well, you know what dentists
are and what mean advantages they
take. But this one, I think, over-stepped
the limit when he allowed the
crown of my tooth to remind him of
the crown of Mont Blanc; paused in
fixing the former to descant on the
beauties of the latter; told me that
from The Salève I should get a better
view of the latter than he, where he
was, was getting of the former; asked
me almost simultaneously if he was
hurting me and if I had been up The
Salève, and told me that I must go up
it and (which I took to mean "or")
that he might have to hurt me.</p>

<p>That was the most critical moment
in the whole Battle of The Salève; the
military critics are unanimous that I
should have then said, "I will go up,"
had I been in a position to say anything
at all. Saved by the gag, I have
won the war against the Genevois.</p>

<p>I have taken the standpoint of the
prophet, who, as you know, is not without
honour abroad&mdash;a prophet with the
policy outlined above. When a prophet
of my sort decides on a policy, and that
policy consists of doing nothing, he
takes a lot of shifting, even on the flat.
And there the matter and I remained,
when there arrived from England, on
or about November 15th, a positive
cloud of prophets, intent on the League
of Nations. The busiest figure among
them is the secretary of one of the
delegates. Pretending to be my best
friend he sought the occasion of a
heart-to-heart with me. I took it he
wanted to discuss Nations; it appeared
he wanted to discuss mountains. I hoped
he was considering them generally in
mass, possibly with the view of making
a League of them. He was thinking
in the particular, and you can guess
what particular. He was beginning to
think of wanting to go up It.</p>

<p>In an effective speech, which brought
tears to my eyes but merely gave him
an opportunity to fill and light his pipe,
I put all the "cons" before him, particularly
the passport part. As a man
speaking with the authority behind him
of a world leagued together, he detailed
all the "pros." We must act together,
he and I; he would assemble the prophets,
I the passports.</p>

<p>I refused to be bullied by him. He
named some major prophets, whom I
should find it more difficult to withstand.
His propaganda amongst them
apparently began at once. Mark the
sequence of events:&mdash;</p>

<p>On Tuesday, November 16th, His
Majesty's Minister-Plenipotentiary and
Envoy-Extraordinary in Switzerland
assembled the British element to dinner.
I have reason to know that he had already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page477" id="page477"></a>[pg 477]</span>
been approached by the secretary.
The Crown of Mont Blanc was freely
discussed and curiosity was aroused as
to the identity, the desirability, even
the approachability of the nearer mountain.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, November 17th, I ran
into Lieut.-Col. His Highness the <span class="sc">Jam
Sahib</span> of <span class="sc">Nawanagar</span>&mdash;"<span class="sc">Ranji</span>," in brief.
He was standing at the entrance of his
hotel in significant meditation. The
entrance of his hotel looks upon The
Salève and past it to the Crown of
Mont Blanc. And that was where he
looked.</p>

<p>On Friday, November 19th, I found
the Right Hon. G. N. <span class="sc">Barnes</span> walking
along the Quai de Mont Blanc in the
fatal direction. His eyebrows pointed
relentlessly upward.</p>

<p>On Saturday, November 20th, Mr.
<span class="sc">Balfour</span> arrived. The secretary began
to talk about a date for our excursion.</p>

<p>On Sunday, November 21st, I became
involved in conversation with Lord
<span class="sc">Robert Cecil</span> in his room in his hotel.
He moved towards the window, and as
he did so Armenia, Vilna and all the
Powers that want to come into the
League and all the Powers that want
to stay out of the League faded from
his mind, and he called attention to
the Crown of Mont Blanc and fixed
his eagle eye upon the mole-hill in
between.</p>

<p>On Monday, November 22nd, the
secretary came to me and ordered me
to provide passports, duly <i>visaed</i>,  for
The Salève party&mdash;seven in all, myself
included. I told him that I would appeal
direct to the delegates themselves,
with whom I had already done some
defensive propaganda on my own. He
told me it was nothing to do with the
delegates; it was the delegates' ladies.
Fool that I was, I had never thought
of them!</p>

<p>That night I wrote in my diary: "At
Geneva there is a mountain. It is called
The Salève&mdash;a nasty name for a nasty
mountain. On Saturday I shall be on
the top of it. I always knew that
the League of Nations would make
trouble."</p>

<p>On Tuesday, November 23rd, I sent
an emissary among the ladies to persuade
them that the summit of The
Salève was loathsome. The emissary
succeeded in establishing this point by
contrasting it unfavourably with the
Crown of Mont Blanc. The ladies
thanked the emissary cordially for her
most interesting information and said
they would take steps to see the Crown
of <i>Mont Blanc</i> more nearly, even if those
steps had to be up The Salève.</p>

<p>That night I wrote in my diary:
"For a year I have fought and won,
but on Saturday the Crown of Mont
Blanc will witness my defeat, and the
whole range of the Alps will look on in
silent contempt."</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning, November
24th, I met Mr. <span class="sc">Balfour</span> crossing the
Pont du Mont Blanc. He was looking
at It with that dreamy smile of his,
which seems to laugh at the littleness
of man and the futility of his policies.
That finished me.</p>

<p>On Wednesday night, November 24th-25th
(read your paper to witness if I
lie), the Crown of Mont Blanc fell
off ... I have left The Salève where
it is. What does it matter now?</p>

<h3>THE ARRIVAL OF THE MANX BALLET.</h3>

<p>The first visit of the Manx Ballet to
London is undoubtedly the most outstanding
feature in the annals of choregraphic
and corybantic realism since
the historic <i>première</i> of the Botocudo
Troupe on September 31st, 1919. And
it is all the more welcome as an indication
of the emergence of a native school,
fully equipped in technique and scenic
resource and, above all, imbued from
start to finish with a high sense of
the paramount importance of psycho-analysis
in eliminating all supra-liminal
elements from the orchestro-mimetic
drama.</p>

<p>The most ambitious as well as the
most successful item in the programme
presented on Saturday night at the
Colossodrome was <i>The Cat of Ballasalla</i>,
that wonderful old Manx legend
of the Princess who was turned into
a cat by the enchantments of the
Wizard of Dhoon and subsequently
sentenced to decaudation by the cruel
Scandinavian invader, <span class="sc">Magnus Barfod</span>.
The scene of the trial in the
great synclinorium of Greeba Castle&mdash;exhibiting
contemporaneous carboniferous
tuffs, soft argillaceous rocks
with choriambic fossils as well as later
dolerite dykes, amid which the feline
amenities of the Princess were illustrated
with miraculous agility by Miss
Agneesh Crannoge&mdash;compares favourably
with the most ambitious enormities
ever perpetrated by the genius of
<span class="sc">Bakst</span>, <span class="sc">Diaghilev</span>, or even <span class="sc">Cocodrillo</span>,
the Sardinian neo-Gongorist.</p>

<p>The music, which is chiefly founded on
Manx folk-songs, developed and adapted
by Mr. Orry Poolvash, is richly suggestive
of the psycho-analytic basic
aroma which pervades the entire scenario.
The absence of a Coda in the
Funeral March which concludes the
ballet is an exquisitely pathetic touch
which could only have occurred to a
composer of genius. The orchestration
is sumptuous and sonorous, the usual
instruments being supplemented by two
Glory Quayle-horns, a quartet of Laxey-phones
with rotating C and C sharp
crooks, a Manx harp with three strings,
and a Miaowola, which gives out the
Death Motive of the Princess at the
various crises of the drama in tones of
sublimated anguish and intensity.</p>

<p>We have only space in this brief preliminary
notice to remark that the programme
includes a humorous extravaganza
entitled <i>The Quirks of Quilliam</i>,
in which a grotesque <i>pas de quatre</i> for
the <i>Deemster</i>, the <i>Doomster</i>, the <i>Boomster</i>
and the <i>Scrabster</i>, forms the central
episode; and ends with a satiric sketch,
<i>The Golden Calf of Man</i>, apparently
aimed at the extravagance of Lancashire
trippers, who are pursued by demons
into Sulby Glen, and released, to the
sound of sea-trumpets, by the beneficent
intervention of <i>Lord Greeba</i> on their
promising to evacuate the island.</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

<p>The news that Mr. <span class="sc">Stephen Leacock</span> has published a
fresh series of burlesques will, I do not doubt, add to the
Christmas jollity of a vast crowd of laughter-lovers. The
name of it is <i>Winsome Winnie, and other New Nonsense
Novels</i> (<span class="sc">Lane</span>), and I can only describe it in that pet phrase
of the house-agents as "examined and strongly recommended"
for the merriest five-shillings' worth that I have
enjoyed this long time. If ever a volume demanded to be
read aloud over the Yule log here it is. Which of the eight
novels is the most irresistible must remain, I suppose, a
matter of individual taste; for myself I found the opening
chapter in the title-tale the funniest thing in the collection,
and that not forgetting the billiard match in the detective
story, a contest that I defy anyone to follow without
tears. To attempt analysis of such happily unforced
humour would be a dark and dreadful task; but I incline to
think that, more than most, the fun of Mr. <span class="sc">Leacock</span> (to be
accurate one should, I suppose, say Dr. <span class="sc">Leacock</span>) depends
upon the sudden tripping-up of the reader in his moment
of fancied security. The <i>cliché</i>, with its deceptive appearance
of solid and familiar ground, conceals an unexpected
trap. Thus <i>Winnie</i>, the thrown-upon-the-world heroine,
asked by the family lawyer how she proposes to gain a
livelihood, replies in consecrated phrase, "I have my needle."
"<i>Let me see it</i>," says the lawyer. But I grow pedantic;
far more important than the method of this little book is its
gift of seasonable entertainment, for which we need only
wipe our eyes and be grateful.</p>

<hr />

<p>In <i>The Royal Artillery War Commemoration Book</i> Messrs.
<span class="sc">G. Bell and Sons</span> have produced a noble volume worthy of
the great record of the Royal Regiment. To the energy
and enthusiasm of Mrs. <span class="sc">Ambrose Dudley</span> is largely due
the collection of the fine material which Major-General
Sir <span class="sc">Herbert Uniacke</span> has here set out in fair order and
proportion. Personal diaries dealing with various phases
of the War on all fronts or with the daily routine of batteries
are here interspersed with articles and poems of a more
purely literary quality and with original illustrations, largely
the work of Gunner-officers and extremely well reproduced.
Among the most notable contributors are Brigadier-General
J. H. <span class="sc">Morgan</span>, Major V. R. <span class="sc">Burkhardt</span>, D.S.O., Major The
Master of <span class="sc">Belhaven</span>, Captain <span class="sc">Victor Walrond</span> (the last
two killed in action), Captain <span class="sc">Gilbert Holiday</span>, Captain H.
<span class="sc">Asquith</span>, Lieut. <span class="sc">Robert Nichols</span>, Lieut. <span class="sc">Gilbert Frankau</span>,
Gunner <span class="sc">Mears</span>, the Hon. <span class="sc">Neville Lytton</span>, Mr. <span class="sc">Septimus
Power</span>, Mr. W. <span class="sc">Rothenstein</span>, Miss <span class="sc">Lucy Kemp-welch</span>
and Mr. C. <span class="sc">CLARK</span>. <i>Punch</i> is represented by several
artists, including Captain E. H. <span class="sc">Shepard</span>, M.C., and
Lieut. <span class="sc">Wallis Mills</span> (both of the Regiment), who have
contributed some delightful colour-sketches, very faithfully
observed. Many of the poems, too, that appear in the
volume have been reprinted from the pages of <i>Punch</i>.
There are brief records of those members of the Regiment
who won the V.C., many portraits of "Representative
Artillerymen," and a Roll of Honour of fallen officers,
numbering 3,507. Lack of space alone prevented the inclusion
of the names of the 45,442 Other Ranks who gave
their lives for their country. Every Gunner who does not
possess this splendid memorial work should have it given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page480" id="page480"></a>[pg 480]</span>
to him this Christmas by some proud relative or friend.
Like the Regiment, it should go <i>Ubique</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p>When Mr. <span class="sc">Robert Chambers</span> decides to give his neurotic
New York society women a miss, and exploit his more
imaginative and adventurous vein, I always know that I
am in for a late night and an extra large gas bill. Like
the British soldier Mr. <span class="sc">Chambers</span> does not carry the word
"impossible" in his vocabulary. Why should he, since he
can give the semblance of reality to the utterly unbelievable?
Then one mutters, "What utter rubbish!" and sends round
to the bookseller to enquire if by any chance there is a
sequel coming out. In <i>The Slayer of Souls</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder and
Stoughton</span>) Mr. <span class="sc">Chambers</span> is at his best and most impossible.
A race of dreadful magicians, the descendants of
the Old Man of the Mountain, who have been multiplying
and acquiring extraordinary psychic powers in the interior
of China for centuries, come forth to do battle with the
United Secret Service for the souls of men. They have
inspired the Hun, and the
Bolshevik has been their
tool. Fortunately a beautiful
young American girl,
who was brought up in
their midst and has learned
all their grizzly powers and
(as it seems) a bit more, is
on the side of the "forces of
law and order." The struggle
is titanic, for these
magicians can slay and be
slain corporeally and incorporeally
with equal ease. I
do not need to tell you who
wins out, but neither will
I intimate how it is done.
I can only say that I
envy anybody who is fortunate
enough to have a
long evening before him
and <i>The Slayer of Souls</i>
at his elbow, still unread.</p>

<hr />

<p>In <i>Uncle Pierce's Legacy</i>
(<span class="sc">Methuen</span>) Mrs. <span class="sc">Dorothea
Conyers</span> gives us once more all that we have learned
to expect of her novels: the friendly, witty, blundering servants;
the hunting society in which wealth and poverty,
breeding and vulgarity, cheerfully rub shoulders; the descriptions
of the wistful beautiful West of Ireland in autumn
and winter; and above all the horses. Added to all this
there are Sinn Fein raids, real and imaginary, to bring
things up to date. A rather unconvincing plot, with a
dash of <i>Great Expectations</i> in it, yet offers a situation
which has plenty of amusing possibilities. <i>Honor</i> and <i>Evie
Nutting</i>, two middle-aged spinsters, find themselves the
possessors of eight thousand a year, on condition that they
spend it all. That sounds, of course, a very pleasant
arrangement; but they have been struggling for years to
make ends meet and economy has become a habit. The
end of the first quarter finds them sending <i>Harris</i>, the
English manservant, in haste to buy a frying-pan with the
last unspent three shillings and sixpence. That the <i>Uncle
Pierce</i> of the title should be really a brother, that characters
should change their names without rhyme or reason from
paragraph to paragraph, and that inverted commas should
make their appearance just anywhere&mdash;all this, I think,
is the author's clever way of suggesting an atmosphere
of Irish irresponsibility, and it is quite successful. <i>Uncle
Pierce's Legacy</i> is a pleasant tale most pleasantly told, and
it is not Mrs. <span class="sc">Conyers</span>' fault, but her misfortune (and ours),
that novels which describe the lighter side of Irish life,
even with the tenderest humour, are more likely just now
to make one sigh than smile.</p>

<hr />

<p>I do not know whether <i>The Scar</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</span>)
first saw publication in any of our popular dailies, but
from internal evidence I should be strongly inclined to suspect
it. At least Miss <span class="sc">Ruby M. Ayres</span> has written an
admirable example of the class of tale, beloved of our serial
public, in which new every morning are the tribulations of
the elect, only to vanish with startling suddenness in the
last days of June or December. For example, <i>Mark</i>, the
hero, begins as the misunderstood son of one of those
widower-fathers who in such stories dwell for ever behind
the locked doors of studies, leaving in this instance <i>Mark</i> to
be the victim of an aunt whose lack of sympathy approaches
the pantomimic. All the usual results follow, even to the
acquisition by <i>Mark</i> of a
faithful hound, which the
least experience of sentimental
fiction would have
caused any insurance company
to refuse on sight.
When therefore <i>Aunt
Midian</i>, following her appointed
course, effaced
this friend-of-man, I confess
that my grief was to
some extent tempered by
a recognition of the inevitable.
Of course, however,
<i>Mark</i> does not remain
for long in what I
might call these dog-days
of his young affection;
love, strong, passionate
and not too slavishly restricted
to a single object,
soon has his world going
round as fast as the most
exacting reader could desire.
For the decorous
details of this delirium I
need only add that, if you want them, you know where
to go to find them.</p>

<hr />

<p>Had I been asked to godfather <i>Smith and the Pharaohs</i>
(<span class="sc">Arrowsmith</span>) I should have refused to stand, unless its
name was changed to "Barbara who Came Back," for the
tale of <i>Barbara</i> is by far the best in this book of short
stories. It would be boastful&mdash;as well as untrue&mdash;to say
that I have read all of Sir <span class="sc">H. Rider Haggard's</span> many
books, but as far as my experience of them goes I find a
delightfully fresh quality in this tale. It may be old-fashioned
and over-sentimental, but in spite of these defects
it has a very definite charm, and its conclusion makes a
curious and legitimate appeal to the emotions. All the
other stories are well up to standard, and it is amazing
that an author who has written so much still shows no
symptoms either of weariness or vain repetition.</p>

<hr />

<p>Those who appreciate Miss <span class="sc">C. Fox Smith's</span> familiarity
with the ways and moods of sailormen and her flair for the
true sea-tang will welcome the new collection of poems
which she has brought out under the title, <i>Ships and Folks</i>
(<span class="sc">Elkin Mathews</span>). Most of these verses have appeared in
<i>Punch</i>, and no further commendation is here needed.</p>

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
